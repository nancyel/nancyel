I studied programming in Turing School of Software & Design (Denver, CO) from 2019-2020 and have been working for startups in South Korea for around 3 years.

* I discovered the art of software engineering in my late 20s, and have been striving to catch up. 
* I learn by doing, through repeated practice.
* Currently, I work with NodeJS mostly and tinker with Golang in my spare time.
