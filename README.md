**History**

- 2019
  - My developer journey began in the summer of 2019 when I joined Turing School of Software & Design (Denver, CO) to learn the fundamentals of software development.
- 2020 ~ 2023
  - After completing the 7-month program, I've had the extremely mixed blessing of working at a number of startups in South Korea. Learning in the wild, learning the most from my talented coworkers.
- 2024 ~ Present
  - Now working as a freelancer, I enjoy working on various projects independently and collaboratively with teams of developers.

**Goals**

My goal in my development practice is to deliver valuable solutions to my clients. To that end, I strive to keep learning, going beyond and expanding my comfort zone.

**Development Tools and Workflow**  

I like developing web apps with a classic tech stack in my VSCode editor:
- Frontend: NextJS, NextAuth, TailwindCSS, deployed on Vercel
- Backend: NestJS, Database and Cache layers, deployed on various platforms (EC2 instance, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, EKS)
- DevOps: Create a CICD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or AWS CodePipeline) for a seamless deployment process
